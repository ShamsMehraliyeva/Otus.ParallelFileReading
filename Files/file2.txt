The term 'obviously' often serves as a linguistic cue that highlights the speaker's conviction about a particular point. It implies a shared understanding or a common knowledge base that the audience is expected to recognize. For instance, when someone states, 'Obviously, good communication is essential for teamwork,' they are not merely expressing a personal belief but suggesting that this premise is widely accepted among those familiar with effective collaboration.
