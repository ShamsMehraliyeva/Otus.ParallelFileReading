However, the use of 'obviously' can also be seen as somewhat polarizing; it may alienate individuals who do not share the same background or experience. This duality illustrates the importance of context in communication. While it can help convey clarity and confidence, it can also dismiss the perspective of others, making it crucial for speakers to balance assertiveness with inclusivity. Overall, the word 'obviously' serves as both a confidence booster for the speaker and a potential barrier for comprehension among listeners.
